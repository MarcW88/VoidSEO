# VOID Loop — Deep Dive Note

> Purpose: Evaluate, interpret, and document learnings. Turn results into reusable knowledge.

## 0) Meta
- **Module/Experiment:** 
- **Owner:** 
- **Date:** 
- **Link to PRD / Impl:** 

## 1) Summary (≤ 5 lines)
What did we run? Why? Key outcome.

## 2) Results & Metrics
- **Target vs. Actual:** (precision/recall, coverage, latency, cost)  
- **Tables/plots:** (attach or link)  
- **Interesting patterns:** (clusters, anomalies, edge cases)

## 3) Failure modes / Edge cases
Where/why did it break? How to detect next time?

## 4) Decisions
- [ ] **Keep** (meets goals)  
- [ ] **Iterate** (list improvements)  
- [ ] **Kill** (justify)

## 5) Actions & Owners
- Next steps, deadlines, who does what.

## 6) Knowledge transfer
- Update docs/PRD accordingly.  
- Add to `/lab/` with a short public summary.

**Pitfalls:** Stopping at “it runs”. Not writing anything down.
