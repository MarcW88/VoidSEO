> Purpose: Identify what deserves automation. Observe patterns in data, user behavior, or internal processes.

## 0) Meta
- **Project/Module name:** 
- **Author / Team:** 
- **Date:** 
- **Status:** Draft | Final

## 1) Context (≤ 5 lines)
What’s happening? Where does this come from (GSC, SERP, CRM, support, logs…)?

## 2) Observed pattern (1 sentence)
State the pattern crisply. *E.g., “PAA topics drift seasonally for ‘trench femme’ queries.”*

## 3) Problem statement (≤ 3 lines)
What makes this worth solving? Impact on biz/users/process?

## 4) Source(s) of truth
- [ ] GSC view(s):  
- [ ] SERP snapshots / keywords:  
- [ ] Other datasets (CRM, CS tickets, logs):  

## 5) Beneficiaries
Who benefits? Persona / team / use case.

## 6) Target impact (rough)
- KPI(s): e.g., coverage %, crawl efficiency, time saved, errors reduced
- Scope: brand/site/locale(s)

## 7) Next step
Move to **Objective** (define inputs/outputs/metrics/guardrails).

**Pitfall to avoid:** Starting from a tool, not a problem.
